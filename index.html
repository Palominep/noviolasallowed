			<h2>
				<center> About Girls Who Code (GWC)
			</h2>

			<p> There are a few things that you should know about me: First, I look like this(and yes, I'm not kidding).
			</p>
			<p>
				1. I like classical music, obviously. <br>
				 2. I took up playing the violin not too long ago and have a good hearted soul and want to help others. <br> 3. The
				purpose of this website is to help YOU. <br> 4. That's not a lot of things about me, I know. 
			</p>

			<p>And, without Girls Who Code, I wouldn't have been able to do any of these things at all. With GWC (shameless advertising,
				I met new friends, and learned how to create this helpful hack for musicians, even when at the beginnning of the program,
				I knew close to nothing about how to code. I learned about the different languages of coding, and how to use different
				platforms, to implement code. Also, GWC is different. You get food every session (probably) and get to work on your own
				project, with assistance from your instructor. And, of course, if you have my teacher Shylee, your in for the best food-
				and sessions. Thank you Shy and everyone else at GWC for being welcoming, funny, and accepting to my weird and quirky
				self.
